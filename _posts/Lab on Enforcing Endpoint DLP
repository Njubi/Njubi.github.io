## Problem Statement

Prevent data exfiltration on end-user devices using Microsoft 365 Endpoint DLP. This lab focused on applying DLP rules to block copying, printing, or uploading sensitive files on Windows 10.

## Tools Used

- Microsoft 365 Compliance Center  
- Windows 10 (Azure AD-joined)  
- Microsoft Edge & Teams

## Approach

1. Configured device onboarding to Microsoft Purview  
2. Created and scoped endpoint DLP policies  
3. Used built-in sensitive info types (e.g., National ID, emails)  
4. Simulated real-world scenarios like USB transfers and cloud uploads  
5. Reviewed alerts and user justifications in activity explorer

## Key Lessons Learned

- The power of endpoint-level control vs. cloud-only DLP  
- Policy granularity (block, warn, audit) and user education  
- How to test policies before enforcement in real environments
