## Problem

Telco companies often face losses due to customer churn. The goal was to develop a predictive model that identifies customers at high risk of leaving, allowing for targeted retention strategies.

## Approach

- Cleaned and preprocessed customer demographics, call logs, and billing data  
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to detect churn patterns  
- Trained and evaluated multiple models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- Deployed final model using confusion matrix, AUC, and recall metrics

## Tools

- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Excel  

## Lessons Learned

- Importance of class balancing (SMOTE)  
- Interpreting feature importance to support business decisions  
- Need for cross-functional collaboration in deployment
