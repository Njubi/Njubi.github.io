## Problem

Organizations processing personal data must evaluate the risks to individuals' privacy and rights. This DPIA aimed to identify risks and mitigation strategies for a new internal data collection system.

## Approach

- Conducted data mapping interviews across departments  
- Assessed processing purpose, legal basis, retention, and access control  
- Scored each process by risk level (likelihood Ã— impact)  
- Delivered DPIA report with mitigation measures for high-risk areas

## Tools

- Microsoft Excel (Risk Matrix Template)  
- Kenya Data Protection Act (2019)  
- Consultation with DPO & Legal Teams

## Lessons Learned

- How to translate data protection principles into actionable reports  
- Importance of stakeholder interviews in understanding true data flows  
- Writing practical mitigation strategies to reduce risk exposure
